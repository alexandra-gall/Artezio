WHAT MAKES EVERY AMERICAN a typical one is a desire to get a well-paid job
that will cover their credit card. A credit card is an indispensable part of life in America. 
In other words, any American knows that how he or she handles their credit card or cards, 
either will help them or haunt them for years.

Credit Services counselors advise, that if an American gets divorced, he or she may eliminate 
all joint debts by paying them off or transferring debt into a one-name account. Even in 
happy marriages, the agency advises that the husband and wife should each have a credit card 
in their name only to establish separate credit histories.

Once debts have been repaid, an American can re-establish his/her good credit by applying for 
a secured credit card and paying the balance off regularly. A store credit card usually is 
the next step, followed by applying for a major credit card such as a Visa or MasterCard.
