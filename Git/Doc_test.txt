What makes every American a typical one is a desire to get a well-paid job
that will cover their credit card. A credit card is an indispensable part of life in America. 
In other words, any American knows that how he or she handles their credit card or cards, 
either will help them or haunt them for years.

For those who are deep in credit card debt, there are some Credit Services agencies 
that offer anyone in America both online or telephone, and face-to-face counseling. 
The counselors may propose a debt management plan. The plan includes lower interest 
payments for clients and setting up a pay off timetable. The agencies’ average 
client makes about $32,000 a year and has more than $16,000 debt in the program. 
Usually the agencies charge zero up to $30 monthly to manage the debt service plan.
