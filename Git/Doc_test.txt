WHAT MAKES EVERY AMERICAN a typical one is a desire to get a well-paid job
that will cover their credit card. A credit card is an indispensable part of life in America. 
In other words, any American knows that how he or she handles their credit card or cards, 
either will help them or haunt them for years.

Credit Services counselors advise, that if an American gets divorced, he or she may eliminate 
all joint debts by paying them off or transferring debt into a one-name account. Even in 
happy marriages, the agency advises that the husband and wife should each have a credit card 
in their name only to establish separate credit histories.

Once debts have been repaid, an American can re-establish his/her good credit by applying for 
a secured credit card and paying the balance off regularly. A store credit card usually is 
the next step, followed by applying for a major credit card such as a Visa or MasterCard.

For those who are deep in credit card debt, there are some Credit Services agencies 
that offer anyone in America both online or telephone, and face-to-face counseling. 
The counselors may propose a debt management plan. The plan includes lower interest 
payments for clients and setting up a pay off timetable. The agencies’ average 
client makes about $32,000 a year and has more than $16,000 debt in the program. 
Usually the agencies charge zero up to $30 monthly to manage the debt service plan.
