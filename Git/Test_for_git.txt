In the U.S. getting a card isn’t as hard as it used to be. 
Some companies now mail applications to high school students, 
rather than waiting for them to get into college. At their best credit cards 
allow their owners to reserve hotel rooms, rent cars and finance larger 
purchases over several months. At their worst, cards allow people with 
poor money management skills to get into a high-interest debt.
